<p>The Greater Boston multifamily market is one of the most competitive in the country. With institutional capital flooding into the metro, every off-market deal gets scrutinized by dozens of buyers before it ever hits a listing. So when we evaluate a potential value-add acquisition at Barrett & Johnson, we're looking for a very specific set of characteristics that most buyers overlook.</p>

<h2>Start with the Basis, Not the Upside</h2>

<p>The most common mistake we see — from first-time buyers and sophisticated funds alike — is underwriting to the upside before stress-testing the basis. A good value-add deal needs to work at today's rents, today's expenses, and today's cap rate. The value-add component should be incremental upside, not the entire thesis.</p>

<p>In Cambridge and Somerville specifically, this means looking at properties where current rents are 15-30% below market — not because the market is soft, but because the current owner has deferred rent increases, underinvested in units, or failed to optimize the tenant mix. That gap is your value-add opportunity.</p>

<h2>Operational Alpha Over Physical Renovation</h2>

<p>Many buyers default to a heavy renovation thesis: gut units, install new kitchens, push rents. That can work, but it's capital-intensive, execution-dependent, and carries significant vacancy risk during the renovation period.</p>

<p>We prefer properties where the primary value creation comes from operational improvements: implementing professional management systems (we use AppFolio across our entire portfolio), renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing turnover through proactive tenant relations, and right-sizing insurance and tax assessments. These improvements are lower-risk, faster to implement, and don't require displacing tenants.</p>

<h2>Location Within a Location</h2>

<p>Greater Boston isn't a monolith. A 24-unit building in East Cambridge near Kendall Square operates in a completely different rental market than a similar building in Dorchester or Malden. We focus on sub-markets with strong demand drivers: proximity to transit (Red Line, Green Line), major employers (MIT, Harvard, biotech corridor), and walkable retail.</p>

<p>The micro-location also matters for exit strategy. Properties in high-demand sub-markets have deeper buyer pools, which protects your basis even in a downturn.</p>

<h2>The Numbers We Look For</h2>

<p>Every deal is different, but as a general framework for Greater Boston value-add multifamily, we target:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Going-in cap rate:</strong> 5.5-7.0% on current NOI (hard to find, but they exist off-market)</li>
<li><strong>Rent gap:</strong> 15-30% below comparable market rents</li>
<li><strong>Unit count:</strong> 15-150 units (large enough for professional management, small enough to avoid institutional competition)</li>
<li><strong>Physical condition:</strong> Structurally sound with deferred cosmetic maintenance — not a gut renovation</li>
<li><strong>Seller motivation:</strong> Estate sales, tired landlords, partnership disputes, 1031 deadlines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why We Pass on Most Deals</h2>

<p>For every property we acquire, we evaluate dozens. The discipline to say no is more important than the ability to say yes. We pass on deals where the basis requires aggressive rent growth assumptions, where the capital improvement budget exceeds 15% of the purchase price, or where the current owner's problems are actually market problems rather than management problems.</p>

<p>If you have a multifamily property in Greater Boston that fits this profile, we'd like to hear from you. Every submission is reviewed personally by Patrick and Tim.</p>

    title: "Owner-Operated vs. Third-Party Management: Why We Do Both",
    date: "2026-02-01",
    excerpt:
      "Most property owners choose between managing themselves or hiring a third party. At Barrett & Johnson, we believe the best model combines the accountability of ownership with the systems of professional management.",

<p>In the property management world, there's a persistent debate: should owners manage their own properties, or should they hire professional third-party managers? At Barrett & Johnson, we've spent 15+ years developing a model that combines the best of both — and we think it's the reason our portfolio outperforms.</p>

<h2>The Problem with Pure Self-Management</h2>

<p>Many small-portfolio owners in Greater Boston manage their own properties. They collect rent, handle maintenance calls, and deal with tenant issues personally. This model has one significant advantage — nobody cares about your building as much as you do — but it has critical limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No systems:</strong> Rent collection via Venmo, maintenance tracked on Post-its, financial reporting done in spreadsheets (or not at all)</li>
<li><strong>No scalability:</strong> The owner becomes the bottleneck. Every issue requires their personal attention</li>
<li><strong>No benchmarking:</strong> Without institutional reporting, you can't measure performance against market standards</li>
<li><strong>Burnout:</strong> Managing 20+ units while working another job is unsustainable</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Problem with Pure Third-Party Management</h2>

<p>On the other end, institutional third-party managers bring professional systems but often lack the accountability that comes with ownership. Common issues we see:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Misaligned incentives:</strong> Management fees are based on revenue, not NOI. The manager gets paid whether or not they control expenses</li>
<li><strong>Tenant anonymity:</strong> In large portfolios, your 24-unit building is a line item. Nobody at the management company knows your tenants by name</li>
<li><strong>Slow response times:</strong> Maintenance requests go through call centers and ticket systems. A leaking faucet shouldn't take 72 hours to address</li>
<li><strong>Nickel-and-diming:</strong> Markup on maintenance, charges for inspections, fees for lease renewals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Model: Owner-Operated + Enterprise Systems</h2>

<p>At Barrett & Johnson, we are the owners and the managers. Patrick and Tim are personally involved in every acquisition, every capital decision, and every operational issue. But we run our operations on AppFolio — the same enterprise property management platform used by the largest operators in the country.</p>

<p>This gives us:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Personal accountability:</strong> We know every tenant by name. When something breaks, we feel the urgency because it's our building</li>
<li><strong>Institutional systems:</strong> Online rent collection, real-time maintenance tracking, tenant portals, automated communications, and institutional-grade financial reporting</li>
<li><strong>Aligned incentives:</strong> We don't charge management fees because we are the owner. Every dollar of NOI improvement goes directly to us</li>
<li><strong>Fast response:</strong> Our maintenance response time averages under 4 hours for non-emergency issues</li>
</ul>

<h2>What This Means for Our Properties</h2>

<p>The result is measurable: lower turnover, higher tenant satisfaction, tighter expense control, and better NOI margins than comparable properties managed by third parties. Our tenants stay longer because they know who we are and can reach us directly. Our vendors perform better because they know we're watching the work personally.</p>

<p>If you're a property owner considering your management options, we'd love to show you how our model works in practice.</p>

    title: "The Cambridge Rental Market: What Owners Need to Know in 2026",
    date: "2026-01-15",
    excerpt:
      "Cambridge remains one of the strongest rental markets in the country, but 2026 brings new dynamics. Here's our read on rents, supply, regulation, and what it means for property owners.",

<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts has been one of the most resilient rental markets in the country for over a decade. Anchored by MIT, Harvard, and the Kendall Square biotech corridor, the city benefits from a deep pool of high-earning renters, constrained supply, and strong long-term demand fundamentals. But 2026 brings some shifts that every property owner should understand.</p>

<h2>Rent Growth: Moderating but Still Positive</h2>

<p>After two years of aggressive rent growth (8-12% annually in prime Cambridge neighborhoods), we're seeing moderation in 2026. Our portfolio data suggests 3-5% rent growth for well-maintained Class B and C units — still above the national average, but a meaningful deceleration from the post-pandemic surge.</p>

<p>The drivers of this moderation are straightforward: new supply is finally hitting the market (particularly in Kendall Square and Alewife), and some of the pandemic-era demand normalization that pulled renters from Boston into Cambridge is stabilizing. That said, the structural supply-demand imbalance in Cambridge hasn't changed — the city is still dramatically under-supplied relative to employment growth.</p>

<h2>Supply: New Construction Concentrated in High-End</h2>

<p>The new supply entering Cambridge in 2026 is almost exclusively luxury product: Class A towers in Kendall Square with rents starting at $3,500+ for a one-bedroom. This actually benefits owners of Class B and C properties for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No direct competition:</strong> New luxury supply doesn't compete with your $2,200/month two-bedroom in East Cambridge. Different tenant, different price point</li>
<li><strong>Absorption of top-tier demand:</strong> Some tenants who might have considered your renovated unit will instead choose a brand-new Class A building, but they were always marginal tenants for your product anyway</li>
<li><strong>Filtering effect:</strong> As luxury supply absorbs high-income renters, it creates a cascade that actually tightens supply at the middle-market level</li>
</ul>

<h2>Regulatory Environment</h2>

<p>Massachusetts remains a landlord-friendly state relative to places like New York or California, but Cambridge has been pushing the boundaries. Key regulatory considerations for 2026:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rent stabilization discussions:</strong> While statewide rent control remains unlikely in the near term, Cambridge continues to explore tenant protection measures. Monitor city council proceedings</li>
<li><strong>Energy efficiency requirements:</strong> New building performance standards may require capital investments in older buildings. Audit your portfolio's energy profile now</li>
<li><strong>Short-term rental restrictions:</strong> Cambridge's strict Airbnb regulations continue to limit alternative revenue strategies</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Smart Owners Are Doing</h2>

<p>Based on our own portfolio strategy and conversations with other operators in the market, here's what we recommend for Cambridge property owners in 2026:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lock in long-term tenants:</strong> Retention is more valuable than turnover-driven rent increases. A 3% rent increase with a 24-month lease is better than a 10% increase that causes turnover</li>
<li><strong>Invest in operational efficiency:</strong> Professional management systems (like AppFolio) pay for themselves through better rent collection, faster maintenance resolution, and reduced vacancy days</li>
<li><strong>Target moderate renovations:</strong> Focus on kitchens, bathrooms, and in-unit laundry where the ROI is clearest. Avoid over-improving for the sub-market</li>
<li><strong>Build reserves:</strong> With potential regulatory changes and energy efficiency requirements ahead, having 6-12 months of operating reserves is prudent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Outlook</h2>

<p>Cambridge remains one of the best rental markets in the country for long-term holders. The fundamentals — employment growth, supply constraints, institutional demand — haven't changed. What has changed is the pace of rent growth and the regulatory environment, which means owners need to be more disciplined about operations and more strategic about capital deployment.</p>
